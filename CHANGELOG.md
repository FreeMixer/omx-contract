# Changelog

The releases are in `debian/changelog` and `packaging/omx-contract.spec`. This file holds what the next release will carry.

## Unreleased

- `scalePosition(travel, value)` and `scaleValue(travel, p)` (`lib/scale.mjs`, exported as `@openmixer/omx-contract/scale`):
  what `linear`, `log` and `stepped`, and the override `map`, mean as a position (docs/scale-position.md).
- `data/scale-vectors.json`: the golden vectors of each law, installed as `share/omx-contract/scale-vectors.json`; 20 Hz
  to 20 kHz puts 1 kHz at 0.5663.
- A log travel over a floor that is not positive is served linear by the library; the validator already drops an
  override entry that asks for one (`contract.override.scale-floor`), and a test holds both outcomes.
